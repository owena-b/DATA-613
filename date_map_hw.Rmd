### Question 1

Generate sequence of dates using `lubridate`
```{r}
dates <- ymd("2015-01-01") %m+% months(seq(0, (2025 - 2015) * 6, by = 2))
```

Extract year, quarter, and ISO week number. Print the data.
```{r}
date_info <- tibble(
  DATE = dates,
  YEAR = year(dates),
  QUARTER = quarter(dates),
  ISO_WEEK = isoweek(dates)
)

date_info
